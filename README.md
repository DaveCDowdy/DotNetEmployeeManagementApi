üöÄ Employee Management API: Refactoring to Clean Architecture
This project documents the transformation of a monolithic ASP.NET Core Web API into a modern Minimal API adhering to Clean Architecture principles.

üåü Project Origin & Evolution
This application began as a traditional, monolithic controller-based API developed following the Learn C# Full Stack Development with Angular and ASP.NET Udemy course by Jannick Leismann.

It has been completely refactored to demonstrate modern C# development patterns, focusing on decoupling, testability, and maintainability.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture and Technologies
The application is structured using Clean Architecture (also known as Onion Architecture), ensuring the separation of concerns and a clear dependency flow (Domain ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Infrastructure ‚Üí API).

Layer	Primary Responsibility	Key Technologies
EmployeeManagement.Api	Presentation Layer: Handles HTTP requests and delegates use cases.	Minimal APIs
EmployeeManagement.Application	Application Core: Contains all use cases, DTOs, and business logic.	MediatR, FluentValidation, AutoMapper
EmployeeManagement.Domain	Domain Core: Contains core entities, value objects, and domain rules.	C# Records
EmployeeManagement.Infrastructure	Persistence: Implements database and external service access.	Entity Framework Core (EF Core), In-Memory DB
‚ú® Implemented Features
Architectural Modernization
Minimal API: Migrated from traditional MVC controllers to lightweight endpoint delegates.

Clean Architecture: Established a strict, layered structure to improve decoupling and maintainability.

Core Patterns
MediatR (CQRS): Implemented the Command and Query Responsibility Segregation pattern to cleanly separate data retrieval (Queries) from state change operations (Commands).

AutoMapper: Used for clean mapping between Domain Entities and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).

FluentValidation: Integrated for request validation, ensuring data integrity before processing.

Testing
Unit Tests: Comprehensive unit tests are implemented across the Application Layer to verify all core business logic (commands, queries, and validators) in isolation.
